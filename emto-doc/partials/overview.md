In everyday life we receive and emit information rooted to our internal emotional network. Often times our expression of these subconscious emotions is abstract, and has little or no value when trying to remediate heated relationship arguments.

It is only after we have a deep understanding of our own emotions that we can reach a certain level of empathy. Empathy is seeing the world through other peopleâ€™s eyes. This is an important step in the path of accomplishing long-lasting human relationships.
