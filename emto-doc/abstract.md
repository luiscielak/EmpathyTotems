Empathy Totems are data sculptures that visually represent personal information to be used as a non-verbal communication tool. These objects are part of a study that explores how to understand and communicate information by conveying data through physical objects. The Empathy Totems will enable people to gain a better understanding of their own emotions while expressing them in a physical environment.

The totem structures combine data-feeds of mood, physical activity, and geo-location gathered form the user. This project establishes a framework to transform personal data into physical structures.
